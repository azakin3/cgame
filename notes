MATRICES ARE IN COLUMN MAJOR ORDER (to reflect GLSL)

dependencies
------------

- gl
- glfw3
- glew
- freeimage
- luajit


ideas
-----

- in edit mode each system has its own window with all entities, when you
  select one it focuses on the right row -- allows system-specific interfaces
  (transform is a tree etc.)


todo
----

- c99 cleanup

- add serialization for lua structures

- fix message system -- right now it uses pointer weirdness and is messy

- make systems add entites to systems they depend on

- make transform dynamic and not reset entities it already has

- try animation

-----

- /: C code for core
- data/ data for core (except in test directory)

- test/: C code for test game
- data/test: data for test game

- data/cgame.lua: cgame lua interface -- can be accessed as cgame.entity_new() etc.

- cgame_ffi.h: C interface for Lua -- used by script.c to bind to Lua
- gen_cgame_ffi.py: automatically generates above, see 'make cgame_ffi.h'
