ideas
-----

- camera is a system with just one entity (initially), has width, height (in
  world units) and needs transform -- then in rendering we inverse move/rotate
  everything and scale based on width/height vs. window width/height

- in edit mode each system has its own window with all entities, when you
  select one it focuses on the right row -- allows system-specific interfaces
  (transform is a tree etc.)


todo
----

- c99 cleanup

- use proper transform matrix (allows translation + rotation + scaling).

- try animation


files
-----

- cgame.lua: cgame lua interface -- can be accessed as cgame.entity_new() etc.
- main.lua: startup script -- run on game start

- cgame_ffi.h: C interface for Lua -- used by script.c to bind to Lua
- gen_cgame_ffi.py: automatically generates above, see 'make cgame_ffi.h'
