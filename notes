ideas

- in edit mode each system has its own window with all entities, when you
  select one it focuses on the right row -- allows system-specific interfaces
  (transform is a tree etc.)


todo
----

- c99 cleanup

- add serialization for lua structures

- make entity system reuse free entity ids

- fix message system -- right now it uses pointer weirdness and is messy

- make systems add entites to systems they depend on

- make transform dynamic and not reset entities it already has

- try animation
