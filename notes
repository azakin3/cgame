ideas
-----

- message system: there is none -- instead you just have a system that
  best does the job you want -- why generic messages? do each thing the best
  way it can be done ('collision' message would just be a collision system that
  stores a dual map of two ids to the collision contact, etc.)

- in edit mode each system has its own window with all entities, when you
  select one it focuses on the right row -- allows system-specific interfaces
  (transform is a tree etc.)

- is the system-data extremely tight coupling right now good?
    - it made it easy to see all the data about, for example, sprites,
      visualize the invariants and make sure they held on *_remove() etc.


todo
----

- make cgame.add_system take only one argument which is a table, and specify
  name as 'name = ...' in that table

- add _clear() functions for all systems

- add real-time Lua running (like a command console) -- bind with editor for
  REPL?

- move window stuff from game into a new window system (bg_color, size)

- serialize global physics properties, expose more physics functions

- add sprite animation

- make Entity type a struct to allow reallocation on deserialize etc.
