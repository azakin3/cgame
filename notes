ideas
-----

- camera is a system with just one entity (initially), has width, height (in
  world units) and needs transform -- then in rendering we inverse move/rotate
  everything and scale based on width/height vs. window width/height

- in edit mode each system has its own window with all entities, when you
  select one it focuses on the right row -- allows system-specific interfaces
  (transform is a tree etc.)

todo
----

- c99 cleanup

- make gen_cgame_ffi.lua get filenames from args, then just list the files
  once in makefile under SCRIPT_HEADERS or such

- use proper transform matrix (allows translation + rotation + scaling).

- try animation
